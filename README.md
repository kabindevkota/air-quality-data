# 🌍 US Air Quality Monitoring Pipeline

This project extracts, transforms, stores, and visualizes air quality data for the United States using the [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/). It is designed for environmental data analysis and features:

- ✅ A full ETL pipeline for historical air quality data
- 🔁 Hourly real-time data updates using Airflow
- 📊 An interactive dashboard built with Dash and Plotly
- 💾 Scalable data storage with MongoDB (nested sensor documents)

Developed by **Kabin Devkota** as part of a data engineering project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-project
cd air-quality-project
cp .env.example .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Your `.env`

```env
OPENAQ_API_KEY_1=your_openaq_key_for_historical
OPENAQ_API_KEY_2=your_openaq_key_for_realtime
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
mapbox_token=your_mapbox_token
```

---

## 🛠 Run Historical ETL

```bash
python etl/extract_locations.py
python etl/extract_sensor_units.py
python etl/extract_measurements.py
python etl/transform_historical.py
python etl/load_to_mongo.py
```

---

## 🌀 Run Real-Time ETL (via Airflow)

Make sure Airflow is installed and initialized.

```bash
airflow dags list
airflow dags trigger daily_realtime_etl
```

The real-time DAG runs hourly and fetches new data for all active sensors.

---

## 📊 Run the Dashboard

```bash
python dashboard/app.py
```

Then open your browser at: [http://localhost:8050](http://localhost:8050)

Features:
- Interactive US map
- Parameter selector
- Time series with AQI bands
- Calendar & hourly heatmaps
- Summary stats (min, max, latest, label)

---
